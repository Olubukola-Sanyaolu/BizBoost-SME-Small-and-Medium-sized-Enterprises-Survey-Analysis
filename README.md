# 1. Business Problem  

Micro and small retailers in Nigeria face challenges such as:  
- Poor inventory control leading to frequent stockouts.  
- Heavy reliance on manual processes (notebooks, verbal tracking).  
- Limited visibility of real profit and expenses.  
- Difficulty accessing financial services due to lack of structured records.  
- Stress in managing customer debts and repayment reminders.  

These problems make businesses inefficient, reduce profit, and limit growth opportunities.
